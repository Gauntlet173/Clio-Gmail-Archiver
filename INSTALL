This is a new process for me, so thanks for your patience.

I think all that is required for installation is that you create a spreadsheet in google drive,
have the right spreadsheets in that file, add the script to that file, and then create an hourly trigger to run the RunArchive
function.

I'll create an issue for getting this more detailed and including stuff about the various authorizations it's going to ask for
the first time you run it.
